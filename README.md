# KNN_Classifier
KNN Classifier to Detect Alzheimer’s Disease based on Samples from Two regions of Brain

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) diagnosis based on glucose metabolism changes in the brain.

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) which is clinically referred to as the dementia of Alzheimer’s type (DAT) is a deadly
disease that gradually causes the death of neurons in the brain (see Figure 1). It is believed that, long before the
neuronal death happens, the neurons start exhibiting glucose hypometabolism, i.e., they become “sick” and are unable
to perform their regular activities which is reflected in the lesser and lesser amount of glucose they “drink” from
the blood. Although, there is currently no cure for DAT, early detection of DAT by identifying the reduced glucose
metabolism patterns in the brain maybe help the development of disease modifying treatments in the future. 


The goal of this assignment is to compare the glucose metabolism measurements taken from the isthmuscingulate
and precuneus regions of the brain between healthy individuals or stable normal controls (sNC) and individuals with
advanced or stable DAT (sDAT). Specifically, you will attempt to build a kNN classifier that can predict if an
individual belongs to the sNC group or the sDAT group based on their brain glucose metabolism signature.
